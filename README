			*------Nessus-grab.sh------*

Script written to grab finished nessus scans, create report, and
send the report via email to the person of your choosing. It is not nearly as effecient or pretty as it could be
but I had a need for something quick that would work.

Tested on Nessus 5 only
Must have linux tools mpack and ssmtp installed and configured.

Script reads a file named login.txt for username and password to login to nessus server.
Place username on first line and password on second line.

This script is written to only email out scans that were performed on the same day
as the script is run.

Pass valid IP of local nessus server and valid email of intended recipient of report

ex: ./nessus-grab.sh 192.168.1.1 boss@company.com
